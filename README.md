# Image-cloner
This is a k8s controller which will watch for Deployment and Daemonset pods and store the image by re-uploading to a bakcup registry from public registry images.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Run Controller and Test it out
- Apply docker credential `secret` in `config/sample/registry-cred.yaml` file. Before applying the `secret`, change the `stringData` key `auth` to right `<docker-username>` and `<password>` in `image-cloner-cred` secret.
  - If you want to update the docker cred secret name and namespace then need to add the secret name and namespace in `ENV` of the deployment inside `./config/manager/manager.yaml` and update the  `RegistrySecretName` and `RegistrySecretNamespace`
```sh
kubectl apply -f config/sample/registry-cred.yaml
```

- Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
```sh
export REGISTRY=<registry-name>
make docker-push
```

- Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:
```sh
export REGISTRY=<registry-name>
make deploy
```
or,
for deploying in kind
```sh
export REGISTRY=<registry-name>
make deploy-to-kind
```
- check the pods are up and running: `kubectl get pod -n image-cloner-system`  

- apply sample deployment and daemonset
```shell
kubectl apply -f config/sample/demo-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f config/sample/demo-daemonset.yaml
```
- now check in the sample deployment and daemonset images, they will be cloned & pushed to your backup docker registry and use new docker image in the deployment

- UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

## Run e2e test
- Added e2e test for deployment and Daemonset controller
- For e2e test follow below steps:
  - run the controller and create the `docker cred secret`
  - run `ginkgo tests/e2e/`

## Run unit test
`make test`
